    "tf.Tensor is the primary data structure in TensorFlow used to represent multi-dimensional arrays or tensors. It is the output of TensorFlow operations and represents the values flowing through the computational graph. Tensors can have different data types (e.g., float32, int32) and shapes (e.g., scalar, vector, matrix).\n",

    "tf.Variable is a mutable tensor-like object in TensorFlow that represents trainable parameters of a model. Unlike tf.Tensor, variables can be modified using operations like assign and assign_add. Variables are commonly used to store model parameters (weights and biases) that are updated during the training process.\n",
